Why PicConv? Because I needed a utility that would strip IFF Pictures
into Raw data files. I had Kefrens IFF-Converter but this was not
compatible with my new Amiga so I decided to write this with an added
function for A1200.
It is fairly easy to use. Load an IFF-ILBM picture and save it in the
desired format.
Format descriptions:

IFF ILBM: Unpacked IFF-ILBM picture with only 4 chunks: Header, Colours
          Screenmode and Body data

RAW DATA: (A)CBM, Raw picture in contiguous format
          ie. Plane under plane etc...

          (I)LBM, Raw picture in interleaved format
          ie. Plane beside plane etc...

RAW MASK: (A)CBM, Raw picture mask, all bitplanes merged to 1 bitplane for use
          with the blitter dealing with contiguous picture data.

          (I)LBM, Raw picture mask, all bitplanes merged in interleaved format
          for use with the blitter.

COLOUR12: (R)aw, data file consisting of colour values in 12 bit mode
          ie. 2 bytes = 1 colour value

          (S)ource, text file in copperlist format of colours in 12 bit mode.
          nb. if amount of colours is less than or equal to 32 colours,
              initialising BPLCON3 ($0106) will not be added


COLOUR24: (R)aw, data file consisting of colour values in 24 bit mode
          ie. 3 bytes = 1 colour value

          (S)ource, text file in copperlist format of colours in 24 bit mode.
          This copperlist will only function on AGA machines

You cannot change the size of the picture once loaded.
You must save the picture as a brush to the correct size and then use PicConv

Beware of loading pictures without colourmap, it will use the colours of
the picture previously loaded. This could be useful if you want to load
the colourmap saved from a paint program onto a picture? works vice versa.

          *-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

I put in a prefs window. With this you can decide what the source (cols)
will look like. It will only change the data statement so for reformatting
you must do it manually. The special character for a TAB is "^".
You can also change the file extension for saving. It will replace what is
after the first "." in the file name or if there is none it just jams it
at the end. Click the mode text to get the next mode.
When saving the preferences select the mode you wish to come up as standard
when starting PicConv. eg. If you want IFF ILBM to be selected when you
first start PicConv then save prefs with this selected.
The Prefs file is in ENVARC: but be careful editting it because there is
no error checking.
1st line is mode to be selected first
2nd line is data statement
3rd line onward is extensions

          *-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

The info window will tell you the dimensions and body size of the
picture loaded.
The dimensions are : X, Y, Colours.
The body size is: Width, Height, Bitplanes

PicConv has been tested on an Amiga 1200-3.0 and A600-2.?

Version 1.0 - I made another program a while back called IFFConv (unreleased)
              I lost the source and I wanted to update it.
              I also remembered that it was the ugliest code I have ever
              written so I didnt try to disassemble it. I wrote, from
              scratch, PicConv 1.0
