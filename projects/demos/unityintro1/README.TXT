"Unity.iff" is converted to RAW-ACBM format
"Unity.txt" is the text for the intro:
add as many pages as you want,
each page can handle 40 characters across and 18 lines down
if you dont have 18 lines down then things FUCK UP!
So make sure there ARE 18 lines each page. I spent 1/2 an hour looking
for the bug in my program until I found out I had 19 lines
in one of my pages...
After every page leave on an empty line an "|" to mark the end of the page.
Look at "Unity.txt" for an example on how it works.
"Unity.s" is the source code, I used ASM-One to create the intro.
Make sure Label: is OFF
The Music can be changed by editing the source code, the path and name
of the module is on the last line. (ProTracker Modules only)
