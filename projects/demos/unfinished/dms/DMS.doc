Using DMS Win for a while I got quite sick of the ugliness and how
awkward it was to use. I decided to write my own with added functions.
It will be easier to describe the main functions once the others have
been looked over.

FILENAME
~~~~~~~~
This can be toggled to PACKNAME for the REPACK option.
The filename is used for both reading and writing. If you wish read a disk
to file then the file to write as should be written in here.
For writing to a disk from a file the source file is here.

PACKNAME
~~~~~~~~
For the REPACK option only. The repacked DMS file will be written to
the file selected in here.

TEXTFILE
~~~~~~~~
This can be toggled to FILE.DIZ
A BBS advert or Banner can be included in your DMS package, the name
of this advert is inserted here.
The text is packed as track -1 with the compression method chosen.

FILE.DIZ
~~~~~~~~
Many BBS's support the use of FILE_ID.DIZ texts nowadays. 
It works in the same way as TEXTFILE only it is packed as track 80

PASSWORD
~~~~~~~~
DMS will encrypt the input from the disk using the password supplied.
It is any alphanumeric word you desire, eg. Fred, ABC1234, ONLY-FOR-ME, etc.

TRACKS
~~~~~~
This is a new option that I have not seen in any other DMS
It selects groups of tracks that you want to be packed.
Usage: #-#  to selected be
