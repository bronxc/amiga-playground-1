Why do we need another module uncruncher? Cause the other ones are lame!!!
Im not saying mine is best, but it works, and it has features in it that
the others dont.
The main feature that makes it stick out is the in-file search. It will
look through the file for a module to depack. So, all you have to do to
rip a module now is uncrunch the intro and shove it in SonicConv.
The program will then spit out a ProTracker module.

Supported module types are:
ProTracker
NoisePacker 3.0
Laxity Packer
Grapevine's Long Dark Teatime Of The Soul
ProRunner (LightPack & HeavyPack)
SoundTracker 15Instr
ProPacker 2.1
HanniPacker
